# Paged Adventures
This project was designed to help Paged Adventures with access control, and database management.

## Detailed Description

Project Paged Adventures is meant to address the issues that the business, Paged Adventures, is currently facing. Paged Adventures is a book store that has decided to renovate their old ordering system to a modern POS system, including inventory capabilities. The POS system will allow team members to take orders, handle money, read credit cards, and give receipts. The system will also include an online database network for inventory that is scalable and flexible to allow for additions or removals to the database.

Project Paged Adventures is meant to introduce a modern system for the business’s orders and payments that won’t require too much technical knowledge for the users.

There are constraints attached to any project. The high level constraints concerning Project Paged Adventures are the following:
    - Scope:
    - Cost (any unexpected cost can decrease the scope completion)
    - Time (if deadline is approaching, cost may increase or quality decrease)
    - Resources (lack of required resources can decrease scope completion)
- Time:
    - Scope (any additions to project could extend the time required to create it)
    - Cost (project cannot be completed on time if all costs are not covered)
    - Resources (a sick employee or missing material could push back the time required to finish project)
    - Communication (Poor communication can complicate and add time to project)
- Cost:
    - Team member salaries (including project manager pay)
    - SME’s pay (any expert required to create the project)
    - Equipment (hardware used to create the software)
    - Materials (paper, pens, staples, etc.)

- Resources:
    - People (any person necessary to create the project)
    - Equipment/Materials (any physical item necessary to create the project)

### Project Introduction

The POS system will allow team members to take orders, handle money, read credit cards, and give receipts. The system will also include an online database network for inventory that is scalable and flexible to allow for additions or removals to the database.
- Creation, modification, storage, and retrieval of order request information.
- Creation, modification, storage, and retrieval of inventory information.
- Creation, modification, storage, and retrieval of purchase order information.
- Creation, modification, storage, and retrieval of customer information.
- Creation, modification, storage, and retrieval of user access information.
- Allows the operations manager to retrieve order information from database.
- Allows the operations manager to validate the purchase order.
- Allows the operations manager to close out the print request.
- This application is out-of-the-box user-friendly, so it’s clear to the user.
- The new system we’ll be creating will allow the employee to send the order with the push of a button, allowing for immediate release of time to take another           customer’s order.
- The new system will require a log-in from the users which will greatly decrease the risk of personal data theft.
- The new system will automate pricing totals which will decrease profit loss by giving the employee accurate purchase and order totals.
- The new system will allow the manager to immediately add the new inventory to the database which will allow for quick, easy inventory management.
- This application is in Alpha

### Core Technical Concepts/Inspiration
- This product exists to make the business run smoother and boost efficiency.
- While it can be stressful for a business to completely overhaul and update their systems, 
it is our position that Paged Adventures would only see positive results from this project. 
Going digital for orders helps keep theft low while increasing profits due to less time spent 
taking orders or fixing mistakes made through employee writing errors. The ability to print 
out receipts for customers will increase the positive feedback from customers, along with 
allowing the business to more accurately understand their finances. Research has shown Project 
Paged Adventures will have nothing but positive influences on the Paged Adventures business.
